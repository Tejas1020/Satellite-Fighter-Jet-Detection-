# Project Overview:
Welcome to our Satellite Jet Detection project, a cutting-edge application of deep learning and computer vision to identify and track jets in satellite imagery. In this repository, we harness the power of TensorFlow and the RESNET model architecture to automate the detection of high-speed aircraft in satellite images, contributing to enhanced aviation safety, military intelligence, and environmental monitoring.

# Key Features:
* Deep Learning with TensorFlow: Our project leverages the TensorFlow framework, a powerful open-source machine learning library, to create, train, and deploy a robust model for satellite jet detection. TensorFlow provides us with the flexibility and scalability needed for this complex task.

* RESNET Model: We employ the RESNET (Residual Network) model architecture, known for its ability to handle deep neural networks effectively. This architecture enables our model to extract intricate features from satellite images, making it highly accurate in jet detection.

* Image Preprocessing: We've implemented various image preprocessing techniques to enhance the quality of input data, such as resizing, normalization, and data augmentation. These steps ensure that our model can perform reliably under various conditions.

* Object Detection: Our project isn't limited to merely identifying jets within images. It also includes capabilities for object tracking and trajectory prediction, crucial for monitoring high-speed aircraft movements.

* Visualization: We provide tools for visualizing the results, including bounding boxes around detected jets and trajectory paths. These visualizations aid in the interpretation and understanding of the model's output.

* Easy Integration: The code and model in this repository are designed to be easily integrated into existing systems or used as a standalone solution for satellite-based jet detection.

# Why This Project Matters:
* Aviation Safety: Accurate satellite-based jet detection can help prevent collisions and enhance aviation safety by providing real-time information about aircraft in restricted or remote airspace.

* Military Intelligence: This technology can have applications in military intelligence and surveillance by tracking the movements of military jets, especially in sensitive regions.

* Environmental Monitoring: Monitoring the paths of jets in the upper atmosphere can assist in understanding the impact of aviation on the environment, helping to address climate-related concerns.

* Search and Rescue: In disaster-stricken areas, this technology can be instrumental for search and rescue operations by detecting aircraft flying over inaccessible regions.

* Customization and Improvement: We encourage the open-source community to contribute to the project, enhancing its capabilities and adapting it for various applications.
